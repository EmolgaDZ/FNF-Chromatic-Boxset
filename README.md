# DZ's FNF Chromatic Scale Boxset, vol. 1 (CREDIT IF USED!)

This is a GitHub repo full of custom Friday Night Funkin' chromatics I made as well as icons if you want to put the characters in your BETADCIUs/covers. 

All audio belongs to their original owners. If anyone wants their chromatic taken down from this repo for any reason, contact me at "emolgagamer0907@gmail.com".
